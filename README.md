 When each user is first created and logged in, each user account will be set to have the same value. There are two ways for users to obtain NFT fragments. 

- The first way is to go to the lottery interface of the dashboard page to draw NFT fragments and obtain NFT fragments;

When the user needs an exact NFT fragment, he can go to the marketplace page and enter the desired NFT keyword into the search box. The platform will retrieve the content entered by the user and return results to the user to help the user purchase it. Wanted nft fragment.
